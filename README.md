# ðŸ‘‹ Hand Gesture Recognition System

A real-time hand gesture recognition tool using **Google's MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**. This project demonstrates how to use pre-trained MediaPipe models to detect hand landmarks and gestures in live video.
> Note: This project does **not** include any custom model training. It simply integrates Googleâ€™s official models and displays output via OpenCV.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Real-time gesture recognition using webcam
- Detects up to **2 hands simultaneously**
- **Handedness detection** (Left/Right)
- Tracks **21 hand landmarks** per hand
- Displays **gesture type** and **confidence scores**

### Visualization
- Live camera feed with hand overlays
- On-screen text showing:
  - Detected gestures
  - Handedness (Left/Right)
  - Confidence levels
  - Landmark positions (normalized and world coordinates)
